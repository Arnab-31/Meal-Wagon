### Team Formation:
A part of the graded work throughout the course will be done in four persons per team. You get to pick your partners.

1. Pick the name for your team. 
<hr>

### Pick a Topic:

Pick a web application project on your interest. Investigate and analyse the project and come up with new ideas. The team will submit a Review on the investigations. To find a topic that interests you, I suggest looking at the topics on current trends.
 
The project must contain the following
*	Must use Apache server, MySQL and PHP script. 
*	Choose the team leader, DB creator, Scriptwriter, Web Page Designer, etc. This helps you to do the project in a good manner. 
*	The project should contain a minimum of 5 forms. Use necessary conditions for form fields validation where ever it is applicable. 

You must do a literature search and identify a bunch of research work in the chosen topic area. You will analyze these existing work and present your analyses to me. Based on your presentation, I may require you to change the scope or direction of your investigation. 

** This should happen before Aug 10th, 2020. **

### Team Reports:
Each team will report its progress regularly. Each team will give progress reports during the course. For all deliverables, the team must submit/upload a final report before the presentation.

All software design descriptions, source code, input files, output files, test results, and so on that you developed during your investigation. These must be posted in a single archive file, either a RAR file, a ZIP file, or a TAR GZIP file. The file must be sent to jayakumars@vit.ac.in with the subject line: ITE1008 J Component. One file per team is sufficient mentioning the team members. 

<hr>

### Plagiarism:
Each team presentation and the team deliverables must be entirely your teams own. No plagiarism. If in my judgment any team presentation or the team deliverables is not entirely your teams own work and submitted or copied from somewhere else, you will automatically receive, as a minimum, a grade of zero for the assignment.
